>oh, this is pretty cool.

a jQuery plugin that uses the canvas element to overlay a fog effect onto an existing image and then allows the user to write over it.

####Features:


Autofit the canvas to any image on the page.
Customize the fog particles, speed, and animation duration.
Customize the brush size when drawing on the page.

####Credits

This plugin was derived from user Jonny C's JSFiddle on particles/ smoke effects with great help from William Malone's canvas drawing tutorial.
