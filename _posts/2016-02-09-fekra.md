Coding from a PSD is fun because it's like a puzzle. And, like a puzzle, sometimes when you're missing a piece you can kind of mush a couple together and then you can't really tell...

This was the third project I did in bootcamp and it shows in the code. But it's responsive! And it was a good learning experience.
